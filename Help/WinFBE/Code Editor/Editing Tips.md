# Editing Tips

These are the top tips to help you edit code faster and more efficiently with WinFBE. Try a few out and before you know it you will wonder how you ever coded without them!

### Tip 1: Duplicate line (Ctrl+D)
Simply move your edit cursor to the that you want to duplicate and hit Ctrl+D. This is great when you have to add a line that is very similar to an existing one and only needs a few minor text edits. 

### Tip 2: Move a line (Ctrl+Shift+Up, and Ctrl+Shift+Down)
This is an awesome shortcut for quickly repositioning a line within your code without having to resort to cut and paste. You will wonder how you ever coded without it!

### Tip 3: Delete current line (Ctrl+Y)

This is a simple one. Rather than having to highlight a whole line and press DEL or Cut, you simply need to navigate your edit cursor to the line and press Ctrl+Y to delete the entire line. The line is also pasted to the clipboard should you need to paste it later.

### Tip 4: Move to next and previous words (Ctrl+Right, and Ctrl+Left)

Quickly move to the next or previous word on a code line. A lot faster than simply holding down the right or left arrow keys.

### Tip 5: TODO notes directly in the code

Rather than keeping pages and pages of paper notes, you can insert one line notes directly into your code. This is done by beginning a line with the comment ' TODO: 

After the ' TODO: phrase you simply type your note. The collection of these notes can be found in the TODO tab of the Output window (Ctrl+F9). 

### Tip 6: Jump to Header/Code/Main/Resource files

Have you ever been editing a source file and quickly wanted to jump to its associated header file? Well, now you can. While in the source code file you can jump to Header (Ctrl+Shift+H), Main file (Ctrl+Shift+M), Resource (Ctrl+Shift+R), and back to the code file again via (Ctrl+Shift+C). This functionality works best in projects where you designate files as certain types (Main, Resource, Header, Module, Normal). You also need to ensure that your header file and code file share the share name but the file extensions are different (headers *.bi).

### Tip 7: Jump between functions in code file (Ctrl+PgUp, and Ctrl+PgDn)

Code files normally have many subs/functions within them. You can quickly navigate to the next function via the Ctrl+PgDn keyboard shortcut. To navigate to the previous function use the Ctrl+PgUp shortcut.

### Tip 8: Block indent and unindent (TAB, and Shift+TAB)

Select a block of text and indent all of the lines by pressing the TAB key. To unindent a block of selected lines, press Shift+Tab.

### Tip 9: Block comment and uncomment (Ctrl+B, and Ctrl+Shift+B)

Fast way to comment or uncomment a block of selected lines. Select the block of lines and press Ctrl+B to comment all of the lines (each line is prefaced by a an apostrophe). To uncomment the block, press Ctrl+Shift+B.

### Tip 10: Jump to sub/function definition and back to last position (F6, and Shift+F6)

When editing code sometimes you see a call to a sub or function and would like to review the original code. Move your editing cursor to the sub/function name and press F6. If the function can be found in any of the loaded files then that function will be loaded and you will jump to it. To jump back to your original code, press Shift+F6.

### Tip 11: Bookmarks (F2, Ctrl+F2, Shift+f2, Ctrl+Shift+F2)

Bookmarks allow you to jump quickly between various lines in your code file. The bookmarker (circle icon) is shown to the left of the bookmarked line.

### Tip 12: Rearrange tab order (Shift+LMouse)

The ordering of the Tabs that are displayed across the top of the code editor can be easily reordered by pressing the Shift key and drag and dropping it with your mouse.

### Tip 13: Column editing (Alt+mouse)

This is a little know trick that allows you to edit the same position on each line. To select the editing position, hold down the Alt key and use the mouse to select down the desired column on multiple lines, Releasing the Alt key and mouse will show a blinking cursor where entering a character will affect all selected lines at the selected position.
